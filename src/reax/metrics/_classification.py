class Accuracy(_metric.Metric):
    r"""Computes Accuracy, ported from [torchmetrics](https://github.com/PytorchLightning/metrics).

    .. math::
        \text{Accuracy} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i^N 1(y_i = \hat{y}_i)

    Where :math:`y` is a tensor of target values, and :math:`\hat{y}` is a
    tensor of predictions.

    For multi-class and multidimensional multi-class data with probability or logits predictions,
    the parameter `top_k` generalizes this metric to a Top-K accuracy metric: for each sample the
    top-K highest probability or logit score items are considered to find the correct label.

    For multi-label and multidimensional multi-class inputs, this metric computes the "glob"
    accuracy by default, which counts all target or sub-samples separately. This can be
    changed to subset accuracy (which requires all target or sub-samples in the sample to
    be correctly predicted) by setting `subset_accuracy=True`.

            metrics across classes (with equal weights for each class).
            - `'weighted'`: Calculate the metric for each class separately, and average the
            metrics across classes, weighting each class by its support (`tp + fn`).
            - `'none'` or `None`: Calculate the metric for each class separately, and return
            the metric for every class.

            across samples (with equal weights for each sample).

            - `None` [default]: Should be left unchanged if your data is not multidimensional
            multi-class.

            - `'samplewise'`: In this case, the statistics are computed separately for each
            sample on the `N` axis, and then averaged over samples.
            The computation for each sample is done by treating the flattened extra axes `...`
            (see :ref:`references/modules:input types`) as the `N` dimension within the sample,
            and computing the metric for the sample based on that.

            - `'global'`: In this case the `N` and `...` dimensions of the inputs
            (see :ref:`references/modules:input types`)
            are flattened into a new `N_X` sample axis, i.e. the inputs are treated as if they
            were `(N_X, C)`. From here on the `average` parameter applies as usual, defaults to
            jm.MDMCAverageMethod.GLOBAL.

        :param ignore_index: Integer specifying a target class to ignore. If given, this class
            index does not contribute to the returned score, regardless of reduction method. If an
            index is ignored, and `average=None` or `'none'`, the score for the ignored class will
            be returned as `nan`, defaults to None.
        :type ignore_index: Optional[int], optional
        :param top_k: Number of highest probability or logit score predictions considered to find
            the correct label,  relevant only for (multidimensional) multi-class inputs. The
            default value (`None`) will be interpreted as 1 for these inputs.
            Should be left at default (`None`) for all other types of inputs, defaults to None.
